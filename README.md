Basic research and fundamental applied research

Such projects address key scientific or engineering questions or develop fundamentally new capabilities. Successful`fyinformation.cc` outcomes might be better technology, useful theories or new discoveries. We use established scientific benchmarks or develop new ones for measuring progress. Although these projects can tackle scientific problems motivated by user/product needs, they often move faster when conducted independently of existing products.
